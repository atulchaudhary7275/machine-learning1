    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "ans-Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that uses L1 \n",
    "regularization. It adds a penalty term to the standard least squares objective, which is the sum of the squared\n",
    "differences between the actual and predicted values. The penalty term is the absolute sum of the coefficients\n",
    "multiplied by a regularization parameter (lambda or alpha), which is used to control the strength of regularization.\n",
    "One of the key differences between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques, such as Ridge Regression, \n",
    "is the type of regularization used. Ridge Regression uses L2 regularization, which adds the sum of the squared \n",
    "coefficients multiplied by the regularization parameter to the least squares objective. Lasso Regression, on the other \n",
    "hand, uses L1 regularization, which tends to produce sparse coefficients by driving some coefficients to zero. This \n",
    "property of Lasso Regression makes it useful for feature selection, as it can effectively reduce the number of features\n",
    "by eliminating those with zero coefficients.\n",
    "Another difference is the shape of the penalty function. The L1 penalty used in Lasso Regression tends to produce sharp\n",
    "corners in the regularization term, which can lead to solutions where some coefficients are exactly zero. In contrast,\n",
    "the L2 penalty used in Ridge Regression produces a smoother penalty term, which tends to shrink the coefficients towards\n",
    "zero but rarely results in exactly zero coefficients.\n",
    "In summary, Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques in its use of L1 regularization, which promotes \n",
    "sparsity in the coefficient values and can be useful for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "ans-The main advantage of using Lasso Regression for feature selection is its ability to automatically select the most \n",
    "relevant features and set the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero. This helps in reducing the complexity of the \n",
    "model by focusing only on the most important features, which can improve the model's performance, interpretability, and\n",
    "generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "ans-In Lasso Regression, the coefficients can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "Non-zero coefficients: A non-zero coefficient indicates that the corresponding feature is considered important by the \n",
    "model in predicting the target variable. The larger the coefficient, the stronger the impact of that feature on the\n",
    "predicted outcome.\n",
    "Zero coefficients: A zero coefficient indicates that the corresponding feature is not considered important by the model \n",
    "and has been effectively excluded from the prediction. This can be useful for feature selection, as it helps identify \n",
    "irrelevant features.\n",
    "Magnitude of coefficients: The magnitude of the coefficients reflects the strength of the relationship between each \n",
    "feature and the target variable. Larger coefficients indicate a stronger relationship, while smaller coefficients \n",
    "indicate a weaker relationship.\n",
    "Overall, interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model involves examining both the magnitude and sign of\n",
    "the coefficients to understand the importance of each feature in predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the\n",
    "model's performance?\n",
    "ans-In Lasso Regression, the main tuning parameter that can be adjusted is the regularization parameter, often denoted \n",
    "as λ or alpha. This parameter controls the strength of the L1 regularization penalty applied to the coefficients.\n",
    "Regularization parameter (λ or alpha): Increasing the regularization parameter increases the penalty for larger \n",
    "coefficients, which can lead to more coefficients being pushed to zero. A larger value of lambda or alpha results in a \n",
    "simpler model with fewer features, but it may also increase bias. Conversely, a smaller value of lambda or alpha allows \n",
    "more features to be included in the model, potentially leading to higher variance.\n",
    "By adjusting the regularization parameter, you can control the trade-off between model complexity (number of features) \n",
    "and the model's ability to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "ans-Yes, Lasso Regression can be used for non-linear regression problems by incorporating non-linear transformations of\n",
    "the features.\n",
    "One common approach is to first transform the features using non-linear functions, such as polynomial features or basis\n",
    "functions like sine or cosine functions. After transforming the features, you can then apply Lasso Regression to the \n",
    "transformed dataset to model the relationship between the features and the target variable.\n",
    "For example, if you have a single feature x and want to fit a non-linear relationship, you could create new features \n",
    "like x^2, x^3, sqrt(x), etc., and then apply Lasso Regression to these transformed features.\n",
    "By using non-linear transformations of the features, Lasso Regression can capture non-linear relationships between the \n",
    "features and the target variable, allowing it to be used for non-linear regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "Ans-The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the type of regularization they use and how they handle the coefficients of the features:\n",
    "Regularization type:\n",
    "Ridge Regression uses L2 regularization, which adds the sum of the squared coefficients multiplied by a regularization \n",
    "parameter to the least squares objective.\n",
    "Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization, which adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients multiplied by a\n",
    "regularization parameter to the least squares objective.\n",
    "Coefficient shrinkage:\n",
    "Ridge Regression tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero but rarely sets them exactly to zero. It reduces the \n",
    "impact of less important features but keeps all features in the model.\n",
    "Lasso Regression tends to shrink some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing feature selection by \n",
    "selecting only the most important features and setting the coefficients of less important features to zero.\n",
    "Solution behavior:\n",
    "Ridge Regression generally results in smoother coefficient values due to the squared term in the regularization, \n",
    "which can be useful when all features are potentially relevant.\n",
    "Lasso Regression can produce a more sparse solution with many coefficients being exactly zero, which can be useful for \n",
    "feature selection and building simpler models.\n",
    "In summary, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression differ in their regularization techniques and how they handle the \n",
    "coefficients of the features, leading to different behaviors and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
    "ans-Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features to some extent, but it does not completely \n",
    "eliminate multicollinearity like Ridge Regression does.\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when two or more features in a regression model are highly correlated, which can lead to \n",
    "instability in the estimated coefficients. Lasso Regression addresses multicollinearity by automatically selecting a \n",
    "subset of features and setting the coefficients of less important features to zero.\n",
    "By setting the coefficients of less important features to zero, Lasso Regression effectively chooses one feature over \n",
    "the other if they are highly correlated. This can help mitigate the effects of multicollinearity by reducing the number\n",
    "of correlated features in the model.\n",
    "However, it's important to note that Lasso Regression may not always select the \"best\" feature among a group of highly \n",
    "correlated features, and the choice of which features to keep can depend on the specific dataset and the regularization\n",
    "parameter.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n",
